<h3> Task 3: Making a decision </h3>
<p>
     We will call the sum of the scaled squared differences our test statistic. In order to use our test statistic to measure how unfair a dice is we need a decision rule. One way to develop a rule is to understand how our test statistic behaves for a fair company. We believe that Pips and Dots is fair so we will use their dice.  
     
     Notice the default settings for this page. A sample of size 30 is taken 1 time and the summary measure we developed is computed. Click the "Update sample size" button and you will see this measure plotted on the graph. Change the "number of simulations" to 10 and observe what happens. You now have 10 dots, each represents a sample of 30 rolls and the summary measure computed for each of those rolls.  
</p>

    <li> We want to know if there is any pattern to this summary measure when we observe a fair dice. Change the sample size and number of simulations and explore what happens. Is there a pattern for how this summary measure behaves? </li>
    <li> How can we use this pattern to make a decision? We simply need to decide when we think an observed value is typical or unusual. Click on the "Show cut-off slider" and adjust it. Notice the summary table below the graph tells you what percent of observations are typical or unexpected based on where you put the line. What slide value will allow only 5% of observations to be unexpected? Does this slider value work for any sample size?</li>
    <li> Where we put our slider is now our decision rule. If a test statistic is greater than our slider value we decide the dice is unfair, since those values are not what we expect to happen from fair dice. If it is less than our slider value, we decide the dice is fair.</li>
