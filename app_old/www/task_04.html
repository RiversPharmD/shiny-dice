<h3> Task 4: Chi-square analysis </h3>
<p>
     Now we can return to the 6 companies and make decisions about their dice. 
    Click on the "Take samples" button and you will see a graph showing the outcomes of that sample along with the line indicated what we expected to get if the dice were fair. Next to this graph you will see the distribution of our test statistic when the dice is fair along with the cutoff value we decided on. You can see the test statistic generated for each sample and if it falls on the reject side (unfair) or fail to reject side (fair).
</p>

<ol>

    <li> Test the hypothesis that each company is fair using a sample size of 100. Compare the observed results to the test decision. Do you agree with the decision made by the test? Why or why not? </li>
    <li> Investigate what role the sample size has on the test statistic and p-value by completing the following:</li>
    
        <ol>
            <li> For a company that you thought was fair, test using a sample size of 10, 50, 100, and 1000. Did the test reach the same conclusion each time? </li>
            <li> For a company that you thought was not fair, test using a sample size of 10, 50, 100 ,and 1000. Did the test reach the same conclusion each time? </li>
            <li> What relationship is there between the sample size and the test statistic? </li>
        </ol>
    
    </li>
</ol>
