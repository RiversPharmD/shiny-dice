<h2>How can we assess how unfair a dice is?</h2>
<h3>Task 2: Developing a test statistic</h1>

<p>
    It would be very useful if we could summarize how fair or unfair a dice is with a single number. Working with your partner(s), develop a single measure of fairness by completing the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose a sample size. For that sample size, what would you expect each outcome to be if the dice were fair? Click on the "show expected line" and see if you agree with the value shown.</li>
    <li>Click on "Show observed - expected values." We now have measures for how far each observed roll was from what we expected each to be. We could summarize how "unfair" a dice is by adding these values. Add the difference values for your simulation. Did anything unexpected happen? How could you fix it?</li>
    <li>Click on "Show Observed and Expected Calculations." The table shows the same calculations you likely completed, along with two additional columns that fix the problem that occurred when you added the differences. Can you explain what the fix is and why it works? Can you explain what the difference is between the last two columns?</li> 
    <li>Click on "Show Summations" and you will see the final summary value for the three different methods of combining the unfairness measures. Change the sample size and observe what happens for each measure. Which summary measure do you think is best and why?</li>
