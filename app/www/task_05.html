<p>
Our test is only as good as the sample used. On this page you can simulate running up to 500 tests of a specific sample size. The test statistics for each test will be plotted and below the graph you will see how many were on the rejection side of the decision line and how many were to the left. 

Only one company produced fair dice, Pips and Dots. What would you hope our test tells us to do everytime for the other companies? We hope that the test will always reject a company that is unfair. How often our test does this is called the Power of the test.test

Complete the following to investigate the power of this test:
</p>

<ol>

  <li> Dice R Us is a company that is close to being fair, what size sample is needed for the power to be near 90%?</li>
  <li> Slice and Dice is a company that is far from being fair, what size sample is needed for the power to be near 90%?</li>
  <li> For the two companies you just explored, how is the sample size related to the power of the test?</li>
  <li> How is the degree to which the truth varies from the null hypothesis related to the power of the test?</li>
  <li> Type II error is also presented. What is it's relation to power? Can you explain what a type II error is?</li>
  <li> Pips and Dots is a company that produced fair dice. Evaluate the power of the test for this company? Can you explain what you are seeing? </li>
